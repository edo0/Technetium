# What is Technetium?
A focused approach to taming the new Firefox 89+'s Proton design, restituting some elements retired alongside the old Photon UI

It gets its name from Technetium-99m, agent used for [Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-photon_emission_computed_tomography)


### What has been changed?
- Icons have been reintroduced, in a smaller menu
- Compact mode has been re-enabled
- Close-tab icon is always displayed, regardless of the number of open tabs 
- Speaker icon always visible on tabs reproducing A/V content
- I wish to thank the [Lepton](https://github.com/black7375/Firefox-UI-Fix)'s developer, whose work served as a base for my less radical restyling


### How to apply Technetium to your Firefox?
-  Enter `about:support` in your URL bar
-  Find the `Profile Directory` entry and click the `Open Directory` button
-  Copy in that folder the `user.js` file and the `chrome` folder from the Technetium release package
-  In `about:support`, click `Clear startup cache...`
